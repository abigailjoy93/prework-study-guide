        <h2>HTML</h2>
        <ul>
          <li><b>Hypertext Markup Language (HTML)</b> is used to create the structure of a webpage</li>
          <li>If a webpage is a house, HTML is the foundation and frame</li>
          <li>The <b>head</b> element contains information, or metadata, that helps the browser render the webpage correctly. This information is not visible to the user</li>
          <li>The <b>body</b> element defines the body of the document. These elements are what are visible to the user</li>
          <li>When using HTML code, it is in best practice to use <b>semantic HTML elements</b>, or elements whose name describe the content and role it plays, as much as possible.</li>
          <li>While element and tag tend to get used interchangably, an <b>element</b> is the information held between the opening tag through the closing tag. Whereas a <b>tag</b> is only what is contained within the angle brackets.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>CSS</h2>
        <ul>
          <li><b>Cascading Style Sheets (CSS)</b> is a programming language used to define how webpage content is presented to users via colors, aesthetics, visual layout, and organization</li>
          <li>If the webpage is a house, CSS is the paint and style of it.</li>
          <li>There are three main methods of using CSS;</li>
            <ul>
              <li><b>Inline CSS</b>: styling an element directly in the HTML file. Quick but inflexible.</li>
              <li><b>Internal CSS Style Sheet</b>: contains CSS rules in the head sections of the HTML file that only apply to the active page.</li>
              <li><b>External CSS Style Sheet</b>: the CSS rules are written in a separate file and linked to the HTML document using a link element. This makes changing the design easier.</li>
            </ul>
          <li>CSS Rules are made up of a selector and declarations. The declarations are made up of properties and values.</li>
          <li>A <b>Selector</b> defines the attributes or elements to which the declarations apply.</li>
          <li><b>Declarations</b> contain the property and value we want to apply</li>
          <li>In CSS, it is believed that every HTML element is essentially a box that consists of margins outside of the element, and the element's border, padding, and content.</li>
          <li>It is best to practice DRY (do not repeat yourself) coding by combining two or more elements that share the same styling using a comma.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Git</h2>
        <ul>
          <li><b>Git</b> is a version control system that lets you manage and keep track of each version of your project</li>
          <li>Note that git commands are different than bash commands, and each command must start with "git"</li>
          <li><b>checkout</b> moves from the working branch into a different branch</li>
          <li><b>-b</b> creates a new branch</li>
          <li>So the code <b>git checkout -b branch name</b> will create a new branch and move you from where you are into it</li>
          <li><b>git status</b> verifies the branch that we are currently on</li>
          <li><b>add</b> adds modifications in the current working branch to the staging area</li>
          <li><b>-A</b>indicates we want to add all changes</li>
          <li>So the code <b>git add -A</b> will add <i>all</i> the modifications from the working branch to the staging area</li>
          <li><b>push</b> will push the changes we have locally to our remote GitHub branch</li>

        <h2>JavaScript</h2>
        <ul>
          <li><b>JavaScript</b> is what makes a website interactive</li>
          <li>JavaScript is powerful, versatile, and relatively user-friendly</li>
          <li>It uses <b>Control Flow</b> to operate, which is the order in which the computer executes a code in a JavaScript file. JavaScript runs from top down.</li>
          <li>Developers can use <b>Conditional Statements</b> and <b>loops</b> to interrupt the control flow</li>
          <li>JavaScript refers to variables as containers because they hold related data in the code</li>
          <li><b>Truthy</b>: when the computer checks a value against an "if" statement and finds that the conditions are met and will carry out the conditional statement</li>
          <li><b>Falsy</b>: when the computer checks a value against an "if" statment and finds that the conditions are not met, and therefore will ignore the conditional statment</li>
