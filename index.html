        <h2>HTML</h2>
        <ul>
          <li><b>Hypertext Markup Language (HTML)</b> is used to create the structure of a webpage</li>
          <li>If a webpage is a house, HTML is the foundation and frame</li>
          <li>The <b>head</b> element contains information, or metadata, that helps the browser render the webpage correctly. This information is not visible to the user</li>
          <li>The <b>body</b> element defines the body of the document. These elements are what are visible to the user</li>
          <li>When using HTML code, it is in best practice to use <b>semantic HTML elements</b>, or elements whose name describe the content and role it plays, as much as possible.</li>
          <li>While element and tag tend to get used interchangably, an <b>element</b> is the information held between the opening tag through the closing tag. Whereas a <b>tag</b> is only what is contained within the angle brackets.</li>

          <li><b>Git</b> is a version control system that lets you manage and keep track of each version of your project</li>
          <li>Note that git commands are different than bash commands, and each command must start with "git"</li>
          <li><b>checkout</b> moves from the working branch into a different branch</li>
          <li><b>-b</b> creates a new branch</li>
          <li>So the code <b>git checkout -b branch name</b> will create a new branch and move you from where you are into it</li>
          <li><b>git status</b> verifies the branch that we are currently on</li>
          <li><b>add</b> adds modifications in the current working branch to the staging area</li>
          <li><b>-A</b>indicates we want to add all changes</li>
          <li>So the code <b>git add -A</b> will add <i>all</i> the modifications from the working branch to the staging area</li>
          <li><b>push</b> will push the changes we have locally to our remote GitHub branch</li>
