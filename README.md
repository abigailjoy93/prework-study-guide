# Prework Study Guide Webpage

## Description

This is a study guide created based off of the information provided in the University of Minnesota's coding bootcamp, start date June 5, 2023. I am interesting in learning to speak code, and it was created as a means to teach me a solid foundation in coding so I would be prepared for the class. It helps new bootcamp students manage the information overload by providing the highlights in a succinct and easy-to-read manner. I learned many, many things including how to write HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, as well as how to debug and to have a growth mindset rather than a fixed one.
